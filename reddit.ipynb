Please make main game like ventures where you can't  drop items or pick up dropped items, we'll all be a lot happier.\\n\\nEdit: for the record I wrote this \\\\*before\\\\* today's anti-duping changes were reported. Just...not a very long time before. Move along, nothing to see here.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nA recent post has prompted me to think: Save the World *literally has a black market*, and like every other black market, it creates an environment for toxic behaviour and counterfeiting.\\n\\nI am of course talking about trading - which is not technically against the rules.\\n\\nHowever it's a rare week when there isn't a post complaining about the rudeness of traders - boxing people up, losing their temper when other players do not wish to trade, and in some cases even 'griefing' the mission out of spite when they don't get their way. This toxic behaviour of course \\\\*is\\\\* against the rules. It *must* be putting people off the game.\\n\\nThere are also vast quantities of counterfeit products out there - duped T5 Sunbeam being the primary culprit. Again, it's common to hear of people being given multiple stacks of what is supposed to be a hard to find item. The beneficiary usually thinks this is great and I'm sure it is, but \\\\*nobody\\\\* should have 30,000 sunbeam, it would take *months* of farming in order to accrue such an amount. It's been duped, and everyone knows it.\\n\\nThe ready availability of duped traps is also ruining gameplay - when someone lays down literally \\\\*dozens\\\\* of legendary 130 traps all around the objective, with no apparent method in mind, it's hard not to assume that they were duped.\\n\\nThe heart of StW is smart use of scarce resources, using the terrain to your advantage, exploiting what you know of how husks work in order to gain the upper hand - the game is at it's best when you're boxing clever. Duped mats and traps mean that people are just spamming traps, and therefore missing out on a challenging gameplay experience. Duped weapons means people are not looking to their own schematics, not levelling them up, not getting to grips with perking them correctly to work well with a cleverly designed hero loadout - again these are strengths of StW gameplay that are simply being sidestepped.\\n\\nIt's also evident that trading has spilled over into real-world currencies too. Even a cursory search on ebay reveals dozens of buy-it-now offers for 130-144 weapons, traps, stacks of sunbeam etc.\\n\\nSo no, trading isn't against the rules - but it's certainly a catalyst for rule-breaking.\\n\\n**But absolutely nothing like this happens in Ventures**.\\n\\nIn ventures, **you cannot drop items for other players**, so there is no incentive for people to trade. It is a much better experience for it. **Less toxicity. Less trap spamming. Less griefing**.\\n\\nI've been against this up until now, but I think it's time to consider extending this policy to main game. It would shut trading down overnight and since it has already been implemented in ventures hopefully it's not a huge change.\\n\\nIt *would* make it impossible to give honest help to other players, I admit. I know it's supposed to be a co-operative game, and it's nice to be able to help your teammates with ammo if they run out, or donating mats to newer players, or even when someone just asks for some spare mats because they're low. It would be sad for this to no longer be possible - but I now think at this point it's a price worth paying, and like I've said Ventures manages just fine without it.\\n\\nAnd maybe in the longer term a middle-ground could be found?

Birds, Chickens and Frogs those 3 animals seem to be fine giving loot in STW aside from improvements they heavily need, very disappointed, Epic Games copied the animals from PVP without improving them, very obnoxious having to put up with raptors and wolves every time you want to farm and loot in private matches getting struck by raptors and wolves every second, I understand people like raptors and wolves, for me I don't like raptors and wolves because you cant tame more then one and they die fast after tame, I just want to play STW how it was originally without having to deal with raptors and wolves if they stay in the game fine but they need to be heavily improved like all the other animals need better AI.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: Epic has released a patch/update today this is good for STW Players, spawns of animals have been reduced, happy moment for STW Players, now you can enjoy the full experience of STW without those obnoxious creatures chasing you across the map, ground breaking news for us all well done Epic Games for listening to the Community.  I want to say BIG thanks to everyone in this reddit who commented their thoughts and feelings you deserve everything good life holds dear, BIG thanks to those amazing souls who had my back when things got nasty, see you the next time things get bad in STW until then Peace, Love, respect to all, its amazing to have loyal fans of STW with similar minds you make STW much better without you STW is not possible.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nCredit  [**ferb73craft**](https://www.reddit.com/user/ferb73craft/) *In the interest of helping the developers improve animals, here's a list of bugs and issues as well as what I would personally change.*\\n\\n**Bugs:**\\n\\n* Animals clip through the ground and die. This is especially prominent with tamed animals.\\n* Animals struggle to path find. Again, this is very prominent with tamed animals.\\n* Using the hoverboard while holding a chicken causes the chicken to be held in the character's stomach. Preferably, the animation should be changed instead of preventing players from using the hoverboard with a chicken.\\n* Picking up consumables (ie: meat) will force the player to wield it, regardless of what they were holding before.\\n* Boars will occasionally dig up copper instead of power level appropriate loot.\\n* Traps and defenders will attack animals, even passive animals such as frogs. This includes chickens being held (traps only.)\\n* Thrown chickens will be targeted by Anti-Air traps.\\n* The change to consumables prevents players from carrying both coconuts and cannonballs in Dungeons (a result of using Blakebeard's Stash.)\\n* Marking / pinging a husk only works once per match, then breaks.\\n\\n**Issues:**\\n\\n* Very commonly, animals of different species will spawn next to each other, occasionally in groups of 4. This often results in either two aggressive groups or 1 passive and 1 aggressive group spawning next to each other, causing a fight to immediately start. This is incredibly loud and likely contributes to the reported lag.\\n* Husks will always prefer attacking animals over attacking objectives or players. This causes husks to run far away from encampments and forces players to restart them unless they have a neon sniper.\\n* Tamed animals will stand in lobber smoke and beehives.\\n* Tamed animals sometimes ignore consumables thrown by the player, even on low health.\\n* Animals use Battle Royale's health bar, which is intrusive compared to StW's smaller health bars.\\n* Boars, frogs and chickens can hide underwater in areas including water, such as tropical zones and lakeside zones.\\n* Various props (such as mushrooms and crops) have a high chance to only grant consumables instead of crafting materials, greatly reducing the player's ability to find / farm them.\\n* New consumables, unlike coconuts and subwafers, cannot be consumed while moving.\\n* Unlike coconuts, subwafers cannot be thrown nor dropped.\\n\\n**Suggestions:**\\n\\n* (Consumables) In Dungeons, the player should have no limit to how many consumables they can carry.\\n* (Consumables) Pressing the reload button while holding a consumable should cause it to switch to the next consumable in the player's inventory (if they have another consumable.)\\n* (Consumables) Mushrooms and corn should be able to be crafted into fibrous herbs at a 2 to 1 ratio. Mushrooms and corn would be interchangeable.\\n* (Consumables) Like Battle Royale, mushrooms should recharge shield.\\n* (Consumables) Meat, mushrooms and corn should be edible while moving.\\n* (Consumables) Add heroes to make consumables more versatile.\\n   * Meat and corn heal x% more health and increase damage by x% for x seconds.\\n   * Mushrooms heal x% more shield and increase crit rating by x% for x seconds.\\n   * x% chance to find offensive consumables when searching containers. Offensive consumables deal x% more damage.\\n* (Animals) Animals should only spawn in groups of the same species.\\n* (Animals) Animals should never spawn near husks or near aggressive species.\\n* (Animals) Animals should have a sleep state.\\n* (Animals) Animals should try to actively avoid being seen by the player and husks.\\n* (Animals) Traps and defenders should only attack animals when they are actively aggressive towards players.\\n* (Tamed Animals) Tamed animals should gain a distinct appearance to separate them from wild animals. This could be in the form of a collar, a colour change or an overshield.\\n* (Tamed Animals) Animals should prioritise eating consumables dropped by players over attacking enemies, increasing with the percentage of health missing (ie: a full health animal will ignore consumables, an animal on 10% health will ignore enemies entirely if food is nearby.)\\n* (Tamed Animals) While having an animal tamed, an emote should be available to the player. Using it teleports their animal to them.\\n* (Tamed Animals) Boars should avoid husks, as opposed to moving once damaged.\\n* (Tamed Animals) There should be positive modifiers for tamed animals.\\n   * Fowl Play - While holding a chicken, movement speed is increased by 50%, +50 armour and the chicken will peck husks.\\n   * Prized Pigs - Boars dig up loot 30% faster.\\n   * Wery - Wolves deal 30% more damage and have 30% more health when tamed.\\n   * Clever Girl - Raptors deal 30% more damage and have 30% more health when tamed.\\n   * Pack Tactics - Husks damaged by a tamed animal take 20% more damage from all sources for 10 seconds. This effect is reset when attacked again.\\n* (Gia) Her support perk should be reworked to also heal the animal based on the player's damage, similar to her commander perk.\\n\\n[u/Chryztos](https://www.reddit.com/u/Chryztos/)\", \"I'm trying to craft some good guns and whatnot, but, all of the ones I crafted are almost all broken.

At this point new questlines, new heroes and new weapons just aren\\'t enough to make this game a compelling experience.\\n\\nI wanted to have an open discussion about what could possibly be done to make this game better. I truly believe that it\\'s been teetering on the edge of being a great game and being a below average game since its launch. Let\\'s address some of the game\\'s core issues and see what can be done to improve them.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**More BR/Creative Crossover**\\n\\nRecently wildlife was added into STW. I think that even though wildlife would probably be pretty low on my list of BR mechanics for them to bring over to STW.. they still have a (minor) positive impact on the game. So truly, any mechanics that get added into STW will have a positive impact, and will add up to a more enjoyable experience. BR and Creative modes have had so many tilesets added to the game, there are so many more locations that could be added to explore. Certain maps could have vehicles.. or there could be a chance to spawn a henchmen base with a vault. Maybe there could be some island maps with boats, swimming and sharks. There are so many possibilities.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Repetitive Gameplay**\\n\\nMost of the missions are the same. We have: \\n\\nDefend the thing\\n\\nDefend the thing (2 times)\\n\\nDefend the things\\n\\nShoot down and Defend the thing\\n\\nDefend things to power up and Defend the thing\\n\\nBuild tracks to a thing, defend a bomb on the tracks, then defend the thing\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe missions that are different:\\n\\nrescue survivors before time runs out\\n\\neliminate enemies before time runs out\\n\\ncollect resources before time runs out\\n\\nbuild radar towers before time runs out\\n\\ndestroy encampments before time runs out (which is my favorite because the game actually ends once you destroy them all.. unlike the 20 minute survivor missions that don\\'t even end once every survivor is rescued)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAll these main quests have pretty much the same side quests. Rescue random survivors, build radar towers, destroy encampments, occasionally defend a thing, collect bluglo to buy boosts you\\'ll hardly notice or to start the mission early.\\n\\nAll of this sucks. All of it. Every single side mission is boring. Most mission modifiers are just annoying and don\\'t alter the gameplay in any interesting or meaningful way. This all got very old for me in the first few days of playing the game.\\n\\nWe need more variety. Now, I don\\'t want to forget to mention.. but dungeons, venture zones, frostnite, and the gamemode where you follow a car and buy upgrades are all excellent additions to the game. But they\\'re all post launch content and some of them (I think) are only seasonal. I don\\'t think STW needs these to be seasonal.. I think they should be integrated into the game as regular missions, and maybe some of the missions that are very similar can be scrapped or reworked.\\n\\nALSO minor complaint, but the voicelines absolutely do not help with the sense of repetition. For the 500th time you start a mission you\\'re gonna hear the exact same voicelines every time.\\n\\n\"we need to retrieve the data before we\\'re overwhelmed by the storm\"\\n\\n\"remember how we said it was never gonna happen? It\\'s happening.\"\\n\\n\"praiseworthy job commander so... good.... job\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nBut what about the main questline?\\n\\nWell I can confidently say most of the missions are to interact with x number of things, or break things to collect x number of things. Your reward for progressing through the story? Audio recordings telling you the story! Not really funny, not the most interesting.. no stakes or danger.. no cutscenes (except for the one at the beginning and the one at the end)\\n\\nsorry if I\\'ve gone off on a tangent.. but there are some aspects of this game that I find truly awful. Worse than Anthem or other atrocious live service games.\\n\\nThe maps are randomly generated.. but they\\'re mostly tiny islands floating in the sky. Once city might have different buildings than another city but it\\'s all sort of thrown together haphazardly and doesn\\'t feel like a coherent world at all. Maybe they could add more into this procedural generation. Perhaps they could try some larger maps. As it is all maps feel eerily similar. It never once feels like I\\'m exploring an actual world. I don\\'t feel anything when I rescue the same few people who somehow always need to find a medkit.\\n\\nSometimes the main storyline made me build something special, or do something out of the ordinary. These missions aren\\'t great but they do a lot to break things up. I think we need more of this. Story missions that aren\\'t just regular missions. Story missions where we go somewhere new or do something out of the ordinary. Look at all the amazing live events that BR has had.. STW has nothing like this in the whole campaign. We\\'ve seen what\\'s possible with this engine.. we\\'ve seen how engaging and awe inspiring the game is capable of being. Even in creative players have created far more interesting experiences and gamemodes. But all we get in STW is an endless stream of fetch quests and audio recordings.\\n\\nNow to the game\\'s credit.. the persistent storm shield bases is a great concept. Building them up and defending them from huge waves is probably the hook of the game. Undoubtedly this is one of my favorite aspects of the game. I wish that it was more integrated into the gameplay. I think it would be great if instead of a main menu we loaded right into our storm shield base. Our armory, hero management, shop etc would all be integrated into this. We would actually move around and interact with people rather than navigate through a bunch of text menus. Maybe expeditions could be more than a mobile game mechanic of waiting a certain amount of time to receive something. Imagine how much more interesting it would be if I actually could play those missions. Take off in a vehicle with one of my other heros and go collect some stuff to bring back. \\n\\nAnother issue is there really are no stakes. Except for losing the rewards and challenge experience (which is more annoying than anything.. I hate completing a daily or two only to lose the mission and having those dailies not count). Maybe permadeath would be interesting. It would certainly get the player to start playing different characters. Maybe you\\'re not sure if you\\'ll be able to handle a mission.. better not send in your favorite character. It would also emphasize making sure you\\'re prepared for the mission you\\'re about to go into. Currently you can\\'t even edit your items or backpack after you\\'ve joined a lobby.\\n\\nMore weapons and heros will not prevent this game from being repetitive. \\n\\nWe need more missions/sidequests, enemy types, areas to explore, gameplay mechanics, etc.\\n\\nOnce again, STW is not a BAD game.. it just never reached it\\'s full potential. It\\'s the campaign or story mode of one of the most popular games of all time. It deserves to be great. I want it to be great.

It is possible that things might function differently for you depending on the intricacy of the issue, of which I do not know as I am not a programmer or such. But this should be a good place to start regardless.\\n\\nSo, there is currently an issue with the Refuel the base mission that causes your game to crash when the Objective is activated. However, me and a friend worked out a solution/workaround to get me past this mission so I can continue the story.\\n\\nSome kind of loading error with the games built in \"Performance mode\" is the cause of the crash, players who are not running Performance mode don\\'t seem to have the problem, and can complete the mission without issue. So while simply turning off performance mode may solve the problem, not everybody has a good enough computer to accomplish this. \\n\\nHowever! There is a workaround! You see, the crash only seems to occur in low performance mode if the activated objective model is loaded in your game. So, if you go to a far corner of the map, a friend who does not need to run low performance should be able to finish the mission for you without any risk of crashing! \\n\\nDo note however: the rendering in this game can be a little finicky. If an objective is activated, and you crash despite being far away/out of view, you can simply wait for the objective to finish before rejoining. For the same reason, it is best to only go after the minimum required number of objectives in order to also minimize the chance of you crashing.\\n\\nIf you do not have any friends that can help you in this manner, it should also be possible with randoms, albeit a little more difficult as communication is not always possible.

Certain missions? And why cant i use the vbucks for it?', 'I\\'d like to preface this post by saying that I don\\'t hate wildlife, necessarily; I see the addition of wildlife as a sign that Epic Games (probably) still has a small team of developers that truly care about the original Fortnite, that is Save The World. I also see it as a catalyst for things to come, and the possibility of further improvements in the near future. \\n\\n(I also enjoyed the quest involving the new Hero, Gia, and I absolutely loved her voice over dialogue, mad props to the voice actress, as well as everyone else involved in the voice over process, including the casting directors, and especially the writers.) \\n\\nThe wildlife update showed us that the devs are still here (somewhere?), and that just because STW development has slowed down, it doesn\\'t mean it\\'s stopped, despite its glacial pace. \\n\\n\\nWith that being said, it\\'s no surprise that many players have voiced concern (and dismay) over the addition of wildlife, with them being a bit much at times, as well as negatively affecting gameplay (i.e. animals luring husks away from encampments; players getting pushed off the map). \\n\\nIn lieu of this, I thought it\\'d interesting to discuss what the player base would have preferred to have been included in \"Fortnite: Save The World\" over wildlife. \\n\\nCrouching: For the longest time, many of us have wanted crouching to be added; someone had mentioned in another post that the reason crouching wasn\\'t added is because there was a claim that doing so would interfere with the Husks\\' visibility, and doing so would make us \"invisible\" to them. Frankly, this seems hard to believe, because crouching in BR seems to have zero affect of the Cube Monsters\\' visibility, and despite my limited knowledge in code, I\\'m almost certain this could be easily fixed. \\n\\nSliding: Introduced fairly recently a couple of seasons back, BR had introduced a new mechanic where players would be able to slide by pressing the crouch button while running. While it does leave you exposed momentarily, this new feature added a much needed improvement in mobility; sliding down a hill also slightly increases your speed. \\n\\nTactical Sprint + Mantling: Introduced at the beginning of the current season, Tactical Sprint and Mantling completely overhauled the way players approach the game. Now players can increase their run speed for a brief period and climb up walls and ledges within the trajectory of their jump. Adding this in Save The World would also allow us to save on building materials, and get out of a pinch when swarmed by a horde of husks; especially if the added feature of the shoulder push was added. \\n\\nPrimal Weapons Set: Despite being a reskin of the Black Metal weapons set, the Primal Weapons are fundamentally different from their predecessor in that their functionality has changed, especially with regards to fire rate. The Primal Pistol is an excellent example of this; despite being similar to the Dirge Song, it no longer shoots at a rapid fire burst of 9 bullets using small bullets, instead shooting at a 2-shot burst using medium bullets. Another example would be the Primal Rifle, while similar to its predecessor, the Midnight Stalker, its scope is omitted, and shoots at a steady rapid fire rate using medium bullets, as opposed to a 2-round burst using heavy bullets. The last example is the Primal SMG, which mirrors the Blackout in appearance, but shoots a steady rate of small bullets as opposed to a 2-round burst of medium bullets. The Primal Shotgun is identical to the Black Drum in appearance and fire rate. \\n\\nAlien Weapons + IO Weapons: Simply put, the Alien and IO weapons would make a great addition to Save The World, as they\\'re vastly different from anything we have in terms of appearance and functionality. I won\\'t list all the weapons, as this post is already rather long, I\\'ll just say that they\\'re all amazing and probably fit better in Save The World than they did in BR. Honorable mention: Rail Gun. \\n\\nCombat Weapon Set: Combat SMG, Combat Rifle, Combat Shotgun, Combat Pistol. \\n\\nSideways Weapon Set: Sideways Rifle, Sideways Scythe, and there should definitely be one Sideways Weapon for every weapon subtype. \\n\\nHonorable mentions: Revolver (Chiappa Rhino), Sidearm Pistol, Tactical Assault Rifle, Hunting Rifle, Lever Action Rifle, Lever Shotgun, Amban Sniper Rifle, Flashlight Pistol, Stinger SMG, Machine Pistol (UZI), Stark Industries Energy Rifle, Chitauri Laser Rifle, Fiend Hunter Crossbow, MK Seven Assault Rifle, Striker Burst Assault Rifle (no scope). \\n\\nIf there\\'s anything I missed, or if there\\'s anything you\\'d like to add or expand on, feel free to comment.', 'And I only find 2-3 a game… it’s really annoying having to replay ride the lightning a ton .', '', '', 'It keeps saying to download the full game but I already download it and own it and I can’t join any match in save the world.', \"All starter pack weapons are in the collection book.
