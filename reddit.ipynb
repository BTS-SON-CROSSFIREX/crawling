He can break this limit with runes, W, and other enchanting items/abilities of his teammates. Every one of Orion's Attacks and Abilities on Champions give him a stack that lasts for 3 seconds. A consecutive stack will refresh the timer until you stopped attacking for 3 seconds. Gaining stacks from separate Enemies with consecutive Attacks/Abilities grants two Stacks instead of one, up to 5 stacks per hit if you rotate through the entire enemy team. A stack gives you (0.5/0.75/1)% MS, (2.5/5/7.5)%AS and (4/7/10) Adaptive Power. If Orion had more than 15 stacks and loses them, all enemies that were stacked upon receive (1/2/3)% max health physical damage per stack that was harvested from them. Alternatively he can choose to consume these stacks before they run out, at any point over 15 stacks.

He uses such staff like military fork (2 pronged military fork) and his horns for combat in addition to navigation purposes, similar to a tuning fork. Lore wise, he would likely be an appropriate fit for a place like Freljord due to him being a Goat with hoofs built for such terrain. Billy as a Champion with his kit heavily relies on vision, some crowd control, and a bit of healing, making him a great tanky support or jungler. The support relying heavily on AP, healing his ally ADC and granting the ADC vision while his jungle role could be regarded similar to that of a Jax or a Yi, building AD in addition to using attack speed to activate a certain passive I have mentioned tied to his Q ability (he would have similar versatility to Warwick, Akali, Teemo and Shaco regarding AP and AD, choosing whichever fits the role he's playing).\\n\\nAbilities:\\n\\nMain Passive: due to Billy relying heavily on his ears, enemies within areas of no visibility that move near him are picked up similar to a slightly larger oracle lense. The catch is that this vision is only applicable to Billy himself so his allies won't see if there is someone near Billy's Radius. This passive will also only work with Billy if the enemy Champion is moving. An example of the ability at play would be a cloaked teemo standing still in a bush vs. A cloaked teemo running around in a bush. The Teemo standing still will not be detected by the passive however, the teemo running around in the bush will be detected. Similar can be said for traps that stand still so Teemo's Mushroom Mines, Caitlyn's and Nidalee's Bear Traps in a Bush, Jhin's Blossoming Lotus Traps and Shaco's Jack in the Boxes won't be picked up. The only trap that will be picked up would be Maokai's explosive seedling minions due to them moving towards their target.\\n\\nQ: Billy does a jump dash similar to Kindred to his opponents. If the opponent is in the way of his jump dash, he lands a stun, similar to a Pantheon stun (the catch is that Billy's stun is like a skillshot rather than a Pantheon or Jax pouncing onto their enemies). This ability can be used to hop walls as well, similar to how Kindred is able to so such with her jump dash. \\n(Optional) Q Passive: Billy bleeds the opponent after landing 5 consistent hits on the opponent. For each hit, a line is displayed on the enemy Champion's feet, each hit eventually forming a pentacle which then commences the bleeding effect. The bleeding effect would be true damage, similar to Darius's ability; however, unlike Darius where he stacks the bleeding effect, Billy will only have it active it once, making the bleeding effect act similar to a burn or a poison that uses true damage (this ability could potentially be paired with a Jungler running Press the Attack Runes for more effective damage). I labeled this passive as being optional because some could argue that this passive might be overkill within Billy's moveset (one heavily reliant on vision and crowd control). I added this passive for 2 reasons, 1st reason being to secure ganks after landing a stun (if he built jungle) and the 2nd reason was for physical one to one solo combat against champions like Mordekaiser, Sion, Warwick, Thresh, Nautilus, Blitzcrank or Galio\\n\\nW: Billy Taps his staff on the ground, giving an auditory queue in the form of a whistle, giving allies temporary true vision of his surrounding radius. This Radius would be similar to that of Quinn's heightened senses (if not a slightly larger Radius).\\n\\nE: Billy starts to hum a musical tune which resonates with his military fork. Billy channels a healing spell, standing in his place, similar to a Master Yi, yet healing allies that surround him as well similar to a Sona or Seraphine's healing ability. This healing ability leaves Billy vulnerable which can easily be used against him by projectile lock champions like Neeko, Lux, Senna, Nami, Brand, Xerath, Morgana, Zyra, etc. Even hook Champion's like Pyke, Blitzcrank, Thresh, Nautilus and regarding enemies in other lanes with similar abilities, Amumu and Sylas. This is a key point because his moveset with abilities like granting vision to allies can be easily regarded as fairly overpowered so having flaws to counter him might be appropriate.\\n\\nR: Similar to Sion's ult and a Nunu Snowball, Billy Charges towards his enemy, the catch is that the enemy is knocked back in a similar manner to Alistar's charge, doing varied damage similar to a nunu snowball (but the ult isn't heavily reliant on damage, rather the stun brought from it). If the person hits a wall, they will be stunned with varied time similar to that of a Nunu snowball. Billy will also have temporary vision of his opponent when the charge has been successfully landed so even if Billy knocks the opponent back a fair distance after landing his ult, he will still have temporary vision of their whereabouts for a few seconds before they vanish. Optionally, while Billy is charging, this could also act like many staff taps going off at once, giving his allies vision of his surrounding area while charging (similar to Senna's cannon when she ults, giving a trail of vision after its been activated).\\n\\nThis might seem fairly overpowered as a move kit though due to his movement being a mix of Melee (like his jump dash and his ultimate) and Enchanter (like his healing song and his vision granting abilities), Billy becomes an extremely vulnerable target to anti tanks builds like Vayne even if he's granted vision of her chasing him down via passive (Billy might be able to land a stun or use the same ability to get away but Vayne will easily be able to hunt him down due to such jump dash being a moderate distance). Other major weaknesses to Billy would be projectile stuns like those found on Lux, Morgana, Neeko and Jhin (to an extent). Another counter to Billy would be Traps/land minds like Teemo's Mushrooms, Shaco's Jack in the Box and Jhin's Blossoming Lotus Traps. Finally, Dive champions like Gwen, Fiora, Camille and Irelia would also counter Billy due to Billy being a Tank in addition to their armor penatration and high attack speeds. Master Yi and Jax would also be counters if they build runes like Press the Attack due to their attack speed.\\n\\n\\nCurious what yall think about this idea regarding Billy the Blind Billygoat. Do you think there should be a support and or jungler built around a mix of crowd control and vision granting abilities or does that seem fairly overpowered, especially when Billy's moves set could lead to him being a pain to gank as enemy junglers if not hell if they attempt to invade or Ambush Billy. Yeah, it might be slightly ironic that Billy is a Blind Billygoat champion granting others vision though it plays off of the idea of losing a vital sense like vision and having your other senses like the auditory sense, develop and become stronger, using the sounds surrounding you to navigate in an echolocation manner. Alternatively, Billy's character design could also be fitting for an Anthropomorphic Bat (perhaps a Bat Demon from Noxus. Would be fitting, especially regarding the Q Passive with the bleed) or even a Minotaur to an extent due to the 2 horns. Either way, Billy would be a pretty fun Champion to play as either Support or Jungle.\", 'Remove exhaust from URF. Litellary exhaust kills the fun from URF.

Just asking\", \"There have been two or three times now that I've gotten lost thinking about how insanely complicated multiplayer games are on a competitive scale. \\n\\nLeague is usually what I think about as its unfortunately my game of choice - let me get this out my head and onto paper so its easily digestible, its quite hard to cover the scope of complexity in any game but I'll give league a go as I have been playing it for over 5 years and although my peak rank (Plat 2) is considered low its still higher than **95%** of players. \\n\\n# Champion complexity\\n\\nOK lets start with champion count, there are **141** champions currently in the game. It takes roughly a year to learn all champions. Each champion has an average of **5** abilities, **4** primary abilities and one passive that is **always active**.\\n\\nThat on its own is 705 variances that needs to be learnt, but not only does the ability and what it does need to be known, its cooldown, damage, mana cost, cast range, impact on a fight or team fight, counters and what role the ability plays in a team fight, also all need to be known in order to **effectively** use it. The effective scale on this is ginormous alone, the precision, timing, decision making, patience and pure calculative power taken to use a single skill is mind boggling. \\n\\nSure skills are thrown out half assed sometimes, but generally there's purpose. Take for example a zoning ability. An ability used to zone off, cordon off, prevent movement to-from or through a certain area to force an opponent to not take a route. This is a whole area of game play in of itself, **understanding** how **strong you are** vs your **opponent**  and how to use that strength to further create an advantage. \\n\\n**Let's think about zoning in a lane and all the information it requires to be done correctly.**\\n\\nThere are your 5 abilities vs your opponents 5 abilities\\n\\nMana, Damage, Cast time, Range, Scaling, Hitbox(what you can dodge/avoid based on size) \\n\\n**There are your champion stat's and style based on type of champion** i.e., ranged, bruiser, tank, mage, support, assassin. Styles differ drastically and should be included in consideration of complexities as there are niche's to every champion and every class that almost predetermine how you will play and approach the entire game. This may not seem complicated but, the reason it determines your entire playstyle is not because it was designed that way, but because the most effective play style, the strategy which yields the highest **Winrate** is what's used as their baseline stratagem. To achieve this there had to have been millions of games played which have resulted in millions of hours of strategy testing which includes, the optimal routes, builds, strategies or concepts used to try win any single game and even those have their own thoughts to consider!!!  Lets cover this later and get back to zoning.\\n\\n**Level of experience**(used to gain levels and stats), stats (Armour vs magic resistance), the champions range, hitbox, move speed, \\n\\n**Then there are runes** which are done prior to even engaging in battle which are decided upon based on your opponents champions, your teams champions and your own champion.\\n\\n**Summoner spells**, two spells with roughly 1-4 minute cooldowns which drastically affect the course of combat and how decision making is tackled.\\n\\n**Which lane you are in**, the lane you are in, top, bottom, mid, jungle, support all determine how you approach zoning. Zoning is a strategy which forces your opponent away, towards or into some particular goal or situation. In league of legends the primary goal is to kill the enemy Nexus which is a structure located on their side of the map in the heart of their base. \\n\\nThroughout the game there are **waves of minion**s which spawn from this structure and walk down the lanes to combat minions spawned from the opposing teams base. These minions grant xp(experience) and gold, gold only if they are killed by a champion. \\n\\n**Zoning** can be used to force your opponent away and off the minion wave so that they may not receive gold or experience thus giving you a slight advantage. But this is only possible if you are capable of winning a 1v1 scenario and thus forcing your opponent to stand back and not risk it as dying poses a much larger threat than losing a couple minions. \\n\\nIn order to zone effectively you need to be more adept at **decision making**, **positioning** and you would need to monitor and asses the state of the game by constantly watching your **map** to track enemy movement as the enemy team roams around the map seeking out their own little edge's and advantages.\\n\\nWhile zoning you need to consider wave state, map awareness, level, experience, amount of gold on you, what you are aiming to achieve and how best to do it. This could be to deny 4 minions worth of gold and XP so that you **level up** before your opponent. Which in turn increases your base stats such as armour, magic resist, attack, ability power, health regen, mana regen, health and mana. Then with all the information in hand we make split second decisions based on information we have which results in both players testing whether or not they have assessed the situation correctly. This results in faced paced combat which takes into account everything. And as long as you have the clear advantage you can zone off your opponent, the issue is that the numbers change, the stats change, based on level, items and even environment. \\n\\nThis is all just insanely large to quantify and I've only briefly covered zoning and abilities. Do you realise the amount of probability, chance, calculations that go into every decision made during a game like this at a competitive level? Let me make this more comparable for yourself. \\n\\nFIFA- Football, soccer, whatever you would like to call it. The game itself, on a competitive level, no, I'd wager that even at a not so impressive skill level, FIFA players, gamers, if they had the ability to control a team and play against a real world team such as Manchester, they would destroy Manchester and it would not even be close. \\n\\nPro level FIFA is incomparable to real world football as the skill gap behind millions of hours of strategy testing by over millions of people would absolutely decimate the real world space and it wouldn't even be close.\\n\\nWhat I'm trying to get at is, how is this data not being collected? If you think about it, at its core all these games are, here's a set of mathematical numbers, probabilities and chances. Work out the most efficient answer to the problem. The problems are so insanely complicated that its addictive to the player. Lets take chess for example with a staggering  **10\\\\^123**  that's 10 with 123 zeros behind it, possible moves or outcomes. Compared with a **real time** strategy game where the amount of factors and variables constantly changing.\\n\\nTake a look at this ability information for example \\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/don4c9yy3sz81.png?width=811&format=png&auto=webp&s=d66134f49cc8f2c569d05893773e124121073b5f\\n\\nMultiply that information by **50** (5 abilities x 10 champions), then consider wave management, zoning, spacing, map awareness, team fights, environmental factors and other creatures which offer advantages such as baron or dragon, items, skill level, summoner spells and runes, then there is your basic league of legends game. \\n\\nIts insane that we are capable of this and, capable to such an extent that a lot of games are lost because of one singular mistake.\\n\\nThoughts?

Everything will need to be re-tuned around the proposed change anyway, so while it initially seems like a simple way to address the problem it\\'s really just adding another complication. \\n\\nThe item rework is what created this meta and its problems and it still hasn\\'t been properly balanced. It put too much damage in the wrong hands, gave people too much damage too quickly, and gave abilities to kits that shouldn\\'t have them. Item strength should be reduced across the board and every item should be re-examined with every option on the table, including removing them.\\n\\nPutting abilities on items is very problematic and probably shouldn\\'t be done at all. Eg. if a champion is balanced around low mobility having movement items in the game throws the balance off. The item makes the champ stronger, so the champ has to be balanced around that strength and then must be built that way. Even without abilities, a lot of items are just so good for certain champs that the champs are obliged to use them and are balanced around them. Sunderer is a prime example of this.\\n\\nReducing item strength also addresses the snowball problem much better than bounties do. The problem now is when champs with strong 1 or 2 item spikes hit those spikes early they are far too strong in comparison to everyone else on the rift. There is a place for early/mid game champions but it doesn\\'t have to be the current feast or famine, be ahead and stomp or be behind and be largely useless. Bounties are a bandaid fix to the problem that created their own problems like champs taking top lane and completely abandoning it.\\n\\nThe main complaint I see with league now is that most games are decided by one lane losing so badly that even if the others did well they can\\'t compete with the fed champ.

Why is this a thing?  \\n\\n\\nPeople in this elo are so frustrated, they know that one mistake just ends the game for them, and a lot of them up the moment a mistake happens, making counterplays and comebacks even less possible.  \\nAnd yes, with the new patch I also hope for longer games.

It is theorised his ult is actually him calling upon kayle, or him releasing stored up magic in the sword, or him using magic. \\n\\nThe first is always a possibility. The third is unlikely as he has no training, and storywise it wouldn't be a great move to make him magical and also possibly more powerful than lux. So this leaves the second. Lux has shielding and light beam magic, which neatly coincides with Garen's shield and massive light beam sword ult. It would be cool if this is in fact lux storing her magic in his armour and sword. It would be cool in lore if between battles Lux would store magic like this, so if ever Garen came close to death or faced against a powerful opponent he couldn't normally defeat, he could unleash her magic and possibly save his own life and the lives of others.\", 'Malphite is insufferable to lane against as he has what is essentially the best poke tool in the entire game against melee champs, since it’s a homing attack which deals a fair bit of damage on top of it being unblockable as it can go through minions, and it is undodgeable and applies a slow. Basically if you pick before a Malphite and you chose a melee champ and some ranged top laners, you might as well dodge as it’s an pretty much an unplayable lane, kinda like Vayne top but worst, since Malphite is extremely tanky even when he builds full ap. So what I’m suggesting is simple, just let minions be able to block the q for you, this’ll at least provide some counter play to it where currently there is none. Since right now all he does is walk up to you, Q then retreat back while you can get to him due to the slow; rinse and repeat until they’re low enough to dive or they have to recal, all the while you’ve zoned them off of both of exp and gold.', 'Time to show you my Spirit Blossom Ahri cosplay!

Thanks!\", 'Quote from patch notes -  \"These changes should not only help better define Olaf’s identity as a Berserker but also allow him to take a new place as a viable top laner.\"\\n\\nTo introduce myself, I have mained Olaf top since S3 on various accounts. I have consistently held a 60%+ winrate on him at around D1/Masters ELO. The last time I played was grinding ranked a couple seasons ago on a fresh account I was at one point around 60 wins 2 losses queueing solo. I ended my run in grandmaster at around 70% win rate overall before quitting ranked. I say this not to brag but to give credibility to my understanding of what made Olaf one of the best top laners in the game. (Better than his jungle)\\n\\nOlaf\\'s strongest aspects as a top laner (Before change)\\n\\n\\\\- Early game kill potential. By running ghost and going all-in with Q you could get first blood about 90% of your games at lvl 1-2.   \\n**After update - Q cooldown is much longer, base damage lower, as well as a longer minimum cast range. This combined with the cooldown only being allowed to reset to 3 seconds significantly hurts his all in potential. The passive change also obviously hurt his early game dueling potential against bruisers that would commit back to you. from 100% max AS Lvl1 to 40% max.**\\n\\n\\\\- W sustain. If you managed to get a kill lvl 1 and survive with low HP you had the option of taking W lvl 2 and life-stealing most if not all of your health back in 1 to 2 W\\'s. Or you could all in your laner when they TP back to the minions while you\\'re below 50% HP getting a 2nd kill at lvl 2.  \\n**After update - You can no longer do this, his overall sustain seems cut about 60-90%. The old W mechanic where all healing was increase the lower you got made Olaf feel like a Berzerker he doesn\\'t feel like this anymore early/mid with the AS changes and healing changes, they aren\\'t nearly as impactful. W shield is a joke early/mid unless you are near 30% hp.W now has a auto reset built in. This mechanic is somewhat useless because you would always follow your auto up with an E to reset/Make use of his auto CD.**\\n\\nAttack speed/Tower killing. - As you got your early lane advantage and kept killing your laner you had easy access to their Tower plates. You would intentionally keep your hp low to get a bunch of Bonus AS for taking plates. This combined with your W attack speed and 6 second duration meant you could secure many early plates or a whole tower.  \\n**After update - Passive gives less attack speed/ W duration cut from 6 sec to 4 sec as well as less attack speed. These changes make it significantly harder to take tower plates and snowball. Not only due to the reduced attack speed but also from the reduced ability to kill your laner.**\\n\\n\\\\- Duels top lane LVL 6 and on. Due to his 6 second ult duration and 6 second W duration you could easily duel just about any melee top laner since they had to commit at a close range for around that duration before one of you would die.  \\n**After update - W duration reduction/Ult duration reduction. The ult being reduced from 6 to 3 is a massive hit to this aspect of his laning. 1v1\\'s/1v2\\'s would rarely last much longer than the 6-second Ult/W duration. Yes you can refresh the duration with Auto\\'s or E now but it isn\\'t as strong as you\\'d think. The duration can only be extended by another 2.5 (This effect doesn\\'t stack) It only refreshes. You would normally use your E right after an auto when engaging the fight. At this point you only have your auto\\'s to refresh your ULT duration. If the enemy flashes or gains any distance from you your ult will now be useless. You can no longer use the ult Bonus move speed to run at them, by the time you get to them after their dash/movement your ult will now be gone. You have to wait till you are on top of them to ult which means you are open to being cc\\'d. Another overall nerf to his kill potential in lane.**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Areas where Olaf is now stronger**\\n\\nMid late / Late game - Olaf is pretty well known for falling off extremely hard, win rates showcased this as plummeting after a certain point in-game. Put simply some of Olafs power has been taken from early snowball potential and put into his MidLate/Late post-lane potential. Although it seems like this might only be the case vs certain comps that can\\'t kite him. If the enemy team can wait out his 3-second ult duration then he is rendered useless and in a 200 YEAR gameplay meta champions should easily do this. He has always operated as a team fight disruptor diving damage soaker or as a Peeling tank shredder.   \\n\\n\\nOverall I\\'d say he can do these jobs better because your ULT MR/ARMOR stay up even when activated. This allows you to get away with dropping a tank item for a damage HP item instead of an HP/RESIST item. Allowing you to dive the backline with more Damage and same tankiness in theory (Although overall ability to drain tank has been significantly reduced). I used to be able to heal from 10-30% to full in 1-2 seconds with VISAGE/Ravenous and W, No longer as easy. \\n\\nYour Q armor shred WOULD be the best part of this buff except for the fact that it seems like nobody plays tanks (I haven\\'t been around much lately so idk). as a late-game disruptor you would try to land Q on as many of the enemy team as possible if you engage - Pop randuins on entire team - Pick up axe again... throwback towards your team through them... rinse repeat. Armor Shred on Q makes this aspect much more potent. So against the tankier teams specifically this is a insane buff which pushes his identity as this type of teamfighter which is very unique and I have always loved about Olaf.\\n\\nAgain these buffs don\\'t matter VS 200 years gameplay champs because they can just go Perma Invis or 1000 Teemo distance dash away during his 3 second ult duration. (I barely want to admit but I think this makes Olaf a lot more healthy, although I genuinely think 3.5 or 4 seconds is more fair)  \\n\\n\\nA couple of things riot said this change will accomplish in patch notes does the exact opposite.\\n\\nRiot - \"These changes should not only help better define Olaf’s identity as a Berserker, but also allow him to take a new place as a viable top laner.\"\\n\\nAs I explained these changes make him a worse top laner. I believe they also kill some of his Berserker identity and give some with the Infinite Ult possibilties. They took it from his old W that increased healing when lower and suddenly giving your lifesteal and a bunch of AS. This fulfilled the Berzerker identity... Suddenly turning the tides with rage when all seems lost. Now his passive is just some permanent lifesteal and lower AS. Leaving Olaf more like a fighter and less like a Berzerker. The W shield quite obviously doesn\\'t fit with Olaf\\'s Berzerker identity and I\\'ve seen a bunch of Olaf mains agree with me.  \\n\\n\\n \"UPDATED PRO AXE JUGGLER Picking up axes now fully refunds **Q - Undertow**\\'s cooldown, but axes can only be thrown a maximum of once every 3 seconds. (Note: The 3-second limit scales with Ability Haste.)\"          **MINIMUM RANGE** **~~300~~** **⇒ 425 units**   \\n\\n\\nThis change also kills Olafs identity as a Berzerker and takes away the fun mechanical expression Olaf had. Even WITH 50% CD you can\\'t juggle axes nearly as fast (So why call it \"PRO AXE JUGGLER\" just call it noob axe juggler please) This was a beloved feature of high skill Olaf players who were able to Throw Q through the enemy and weave in Auto\\'s as you pass cancel with E pick up axe repeat all with high AS. This feature is dead and I\\'m not sure why they killed it.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWhat I think Riot should do going forward with Olaf. \\n\\nFor the love of Olaf mains please let us juggle our axes. Riot has completely gutted this feature.\\n\\nLower the \"axes can only be thrown a maximum of once every 3 seconds. (Note: The 3-second limit scales with Ability Haste.) Perhaps to 2-second limit scales to .5 seconds or 0 at 100% Ability Haste  \\nYou used to be able to have it on a 0-second CD with not much CD! Why nerf it so hard?\\n\\nMaybe even lower axe CD from 9 to 8, 8 feels extremely unforgiving especially in top lane.  \\n\\n\\nChange ult so that your first auto and E \"INCREASE\" his ult duration by 1.5 each to 6 seconds. Not refresh. Beyond that keep every auto and E as refreshing his ult by 3 seconds.  \\nThis or maybe change his ult duration to 3.5 or 4 seconds. (I\\'m not 100% sure a change is needed here yet)  \\n\\n\\nE is fine always has been, we love it. Don\\'t touch it.\\n\\nMaybe build a passive feature into his W where ALL healing and Shielding on Olaf is increased as he gets lower down to 30% HP. I\\'d be ok with weakening his shield to be able to keep this old feature. We loved it, it was where most of his berzerker identity came from.   \\nIt doesn\\'t have to be much. Maybe even just make it so all healing and shielding are increased on him while his ULT or W is active? there are many options here to keep this identity.   \\n\\n\\nOverall I truly believe Olaf is in a healthier state now, these changes are in the right direction, and I\\'m generally happy.\\n\\n \\n\\ndoesnt work vs 200 years', 'So I saw there was something on Prime Gaming and claimed it, it said you\\'d get an emote AND a prime capsule, and while I got the \"Scareprise!\" instantly it\\'s been over 24 hours with no capsules in my loot.\\nHow does that work?

Though Dig will need a resident top if they stick with Blue and River which seems the most ideal at the moment and look at that Gamsu is already a declared North American resident from his time with Dignitas back in 2014 with CoreJJ(ADC). I think this might be a shock to a lot of people but he was looking good in Academy. Also there is no buy out for a declared resident that has LCS potential. This also aligns with the the logic of adding another Korean to pair with river to help him adapt to NA and in their environment. \\n\\n(Context Note)\\n\\nGamsu was a profession Korean league player(Top) from 2013 - 2016 most noted for coming over to NA to play on Dig with CoreJJ(Back when Core was an ADC).  which was a large failure that probably had a lot more to do with the org then the players.

The lane would change a lot, considering that current laners might not synergize well with someone else in a lane where they usually play alone.\\n\\n2 - Two junglers would have a very powerful pressure everywhere because they would be very strong in ganks (4v2/3v1 or split and gank multiple lanes) or while invading and taking objectives. This is probably the strongest comp, in my opinion, if we don't take into account the problem of splitting XP and gold between junglers, which might weaken them a lot.\\n\\n3 - Two midlaners with 2 strong roamers would be another option with a nice pressure potential, while 1 stays in lane the other attacks somewhere else with the jungler or alone while the jungler attacks the opposite lane.

Let me start by explaining that I am not a smurf. I am just a hardstuck. I did reach Diamond in seasons 4 - 8 sure. But I was one tricking the old Akali. Due to RL I decayed out of Diamond in seasons 5-8 but i\\'ve added some other images to prove I got diamond those seasons. Since then i\\'ve never gotten higher than Mid Platinum.\\n\\nSo Sure I was good in the past but now i\\'m a washed up hardstuck.\\n\\nSo How did I do this? Well It is simple. I believe due to overwhelming evidence that Matchmaking differs depending on how much LP you are getting; and it is especially prevalent since smurf que was added. I\\'ll Elaborate.   \\n\\n\\nIf you\\'re getting 10-13 LP per win your Elo/Mmr is arguably lower than your LP. What this means to the system is that You are NOT a smurf. You be matchmade in well balanced winnable games if you are getting between 10-13 LP.   \\n\\n\\n14 LP - This seems to be the middle point. Games are not as easy but it does not seem like smurf queue happens yet or very often.   \\n\\n\\n15 LP Per win. You will be matchmade with smurfs often. Just Mild Smurf que.  \\n16 Same as above  \\n17 Lp Per win. Coin Flip Smurf Games often.  \\n\\n\\nIt was always very easy for me to get platinum in the past But since the matchmaking changes in season 10 where Rito \"made the climb longer\" [https://www.dexerto.com/league-of-legends/lol-devs-explain-season-10-ranked-climb-longer-1330270/#:\\\\~:text=After%20one%20player%20called%20out,climb%20%E2%80%9Ca%20lot%20longer.%E2%80%9D](https://www.dexerto.com/league-of-legends/lol-devs-explain-season-10-ranked-climb-longer-1330270/#:~:text=After%20one%20player%20called%20out,climb%20%E2%80%9Ca%20lot%20longer.%E2%80%9D)  \\n\\n\\n\\\\^\\\\^ After the season 10 matchmaking updates I seem to have a very hard time. What happens is I go on win streaks like below and then get put in some very horrendous matches afterwards.   \\n\\n\\nThis is not the only time ive climbed with a similar win rate like this.   \\n\\n\\nIn fact anytime im in gold 4 gaining 13 or less LP Per win I will win 70% or more of my games until i start gaining 14 or more LP all the way to Platinum. Usually I get stuck around Plat 3 But the same rule holds true if I get low LP gains in Platinum.   \\n\\n\\nAs long as i\\'m gaining 13 or less LP I will climb to plat 3 series to Plat 4. But otherwise I don\\'t climb easily. I can still climb but it will be like at 55% win rate.   \\n\\n\\nTLDR - If you\\'re gaining 13 or less LP Per win games are easier to Influence and Win. Since The Smurf Que / Matchmaking updates of season 10 and 11 I can not win streak a whole division unless i\\'m gaining less than 13 lp per win. I\\'ve done this at least a dozen times from low gold to Mid Platinum.  \\n\\n\\nCurrently I\\'m stuck in Mid Gold getting 14-16 per win. \\n\\nIf you want to repeat my success I suggest you play Top Lane and play a champion that carries team fights to victory.

The thing that is really lame about this pattern is it basically encourages you to lose games to lower your lp gains.   \\n\\n\\nMatchmaking update / smurf que did some weird things to the ladder. \\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/flcda6pyhiz81.png?width=232&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2aed6dd9bfd51c4161f70339c3e2b2566311592\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/66zvrvhyhiz81.png?width=239&format=png&auto=webp&s=65a2a56edf965cda571324e0c7f633d2ef0e8b6c\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kt6270vljiz81.png?width=1148&format=png&auto=webp&s=579c844f1cea505768107dec95e72192408662e8\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ls1uybkljiz81.png?width=1153&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5a62e10726bac08899343d323d82c38e3a76643\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o2lu128mjiz81.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ff3c7f69dc72c7538b5ded7c76d083f3862e5b0', 'https://twitter.com/SoloQChallenge/status/1525598252174823424?t=E71X9yHqFz2yL3SwvwrQSg&s=19\\n\\nSoloQChallenge is a competition between different streamers, players etc to see who reaches the higher rank\\n.

At the end it balances out somehow for the rank that you eventually get stuck at.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIt frustrates me that someone can have equal if not slightly better skills than another player, but still lose simply because of the difference in champions.

I probably collected 100 or more emotes from the capsules since Worlds and I have a huge overflow too. Why would anyone still need old content, hasn\\'t everyone gotten so many emotes that they just disenchant them?  \\n\\n\\nMy suggestion would be to make old esports emotes rerollable once a new batch comes out, but then you should only be able to drop the new ones. Even if they include boring grey icons, atleast the rewards are fresh and you aren\\'t getting spammed with old content.  \\n\\n\\nWhat is your guys thoughts about this, do you see an issue similar to me or am I just overreacting out of emote addiction?  \\n\\\\#we need more emote slots', \"I myself thought PSG Talon might be able to put up a good fight and maybe, just maybe reach the finals of the MSI.

Then the strongest wildcard from each group plays the weakest of the other group in a b05, with the winner of that moving on to face LPL or LCK in the quarterfinals.\\n\\nThe wildcard teams that finish 2nd in their group would face eachother in a b05 to see who moves on to play vs LEC in the quarterfinals.\\n\\nLCS and PCS will play eachother in the quarterfinals as they are reasonably similar in skill and are generally (outside of MSI last year where PCS did really well) battling for 4th place.\\n\\nFrom there on it's just best of 5s until the end.\\n\\nWhat do you think of this format? What would you like to see? Would you change anything or do you like the way it is currently?\\n\\nAll scores are purely hypothetical.\\n\\nEDIT: In hindsight it'd probably be better to put LCK and LPL on opposite sides of the bracket, but that's not a difficult fix - fixed the image.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jl0kn37acgz81.png?width=3024&format=png&auto=webp&s=47b5fbfce0b818264d8c320454e372aca80ac47d\", \"Hey all!  \\n\\n\\nWas just wondering if it was okay to find people for clash on this reddit?\\n\\nI had a read of the rules and couldn't find anything specific about it.

I know there are ping issues and what not, but is that the only reason, we see this happening? Even as a LEC fan i am completely shocked how easy G2 is crusing through this stage, while they looked shacky all spring until their run started. The only team i thought would show this dominance was T1, but it seems like the major regions just pick up stomp after stomp to a point, were i feel bad for the wildcard teams.

So after Swain murked Darkwill and took control of Noxus, he set up the Trifarix which is where three people together run and govern different aspects of Noxus. We know that these three are Swain, Darius, and LeBlanc (or at least a puppet for her), but I'm confused as to why Swain designed it this way. The reason he created the Trifarix in the first place was to diminish Leblanc's grasp of power over Noxus since she keeps controlling every leader into corruption. The logic is supposedly if one leader is corrupted, then the other two can step in and hold them back. But that's the problem: one of the leaders IS Leblanc, and Swain knows this, so we did he only appoint 3 branches?

What about his teammates ?  \\n(an ahri in arurf in an example)\\n\\n5) If some people watch YT channel of \"Vars\" or simply play LoL for a long time, they know lot of (new) champs are totally broken op.  If not tryharding, you basically can\\'t win against a team having a op champ(s)\\n\\n6) Saying others of being tryhard because they destroy the nexus and not letting the game go on more, is just a question of preference.

Also who dislike seeing the game say you win ?  \\nBeside a ARAM where it was a enjoyable game where everyone was playing wholesomely/teamwork or really interestingly in both camps, where even the global chat was wholesome/joking, i don\\'t think there are other possibilities where a team let the other team win with a true 100% happy smile.\\n\\nAnd it\\'s also more because RIOT balancing is entirely s.................SUPERB  \\nHehehe, it is SO ENJOYABLE fighting a pyke/GP with 2 items/viego\\n\\n\\\\-----------------\\n\\nAnyway, people that are not tryhards are the \"noobs\" that quit because of community or the difficulty of the game, or they are plastic/wood ELO, or the ones that only do \"VS AI\" mode', \"It used to be that you needed to prioritise URF champions, there's even a page that ranks them by S, A, B, C etc. Basically pick the champs that are broken in URF and you likely will win. \\n\\nBut now it seems like it's no longer important.

Second day of ARURF and I\\'m pretty much already over it.\\n\\nInb4 the \"it\\'s for fun\" comments, but I think that is where the problem lies: not very fun lots of the time. Other than the obvious cases of rolling a garbage champ selection and getting stomped in 10 mins or rolling melee champs into ranged and getting bullied into your fountain unless you build tank stats (soooooo fun /s), I noticed even rolling cheesy OP champs isn\\'t fun due to how much of a stomp it usually is now.\\n\\nYears ago you could build off-meta items on your champs and do surprisingly well on a lot of them. Sure you can still do this sometimes today (attack speed Braum), but most of the time you are just gonna grief yourself and your team. So tanks are left to build \"tank\" (again, soooo fun for you and the other team) and damage champs are left to build typical damage builds. Maybe it\\'s due to regular SR having URF damage for the past couple seasons now that the gamemode has lost it\\'s charm.\\n\\nStrangely, anyone else notice how some URF staple champs are kinda lacklustre these days? I\\'m talking Karthus, Cass, even AP Malph isn\\'t as fun/strong comparatively to everything now.\\n\\nAlso, are respawn timers usually this apparent in URF? I see nearly 1 minute respawn timers at 15 minutes, which causes games to end before lots of players even reach the power fantasy that URF is supposed to provide. This is especially noticeable since towers are solely cosmetic 10 mins in. I have seen many \"comebacks\" because players don\\'t realize that their timers have gained 40 seconds in 5 minutes and thus lose the game after the first real team fight.\\n\\nUltimate spellbook has replaced URF as my favorite for fun gamemode.

Since dorans blade is 450g, that means Ezreal thinks its actually worth 4500 and I would argue this is completely unreasonable.\\n\\nAssuming 1 cs is worth 20g on average, according to Ez you shouldnt be able to buy Dorans blade until you have 225 farm which happens at about minute 23 if you are good at farming. Just buying full dorans + boots with this pricing would take over 1.5 hours. At this point, everyone would most likely be level 18 and taking objectives such as Baron would be incredibly hard with just a dorans blade build.  \\n\\n\\nObviously items like infinity edge and trinity force are a lot stronger than dorans blade, which means these items should be priced well above 4500g using Ezreals logic. This would ultimately lead to games being several hours long taking potentially a whole day to finish. As a consequence, pro leagues and international events would be almost impossible to follow since no one has time to watch a best of 5 series where each game is several hour long.  \\n\\n\\nSo what do you think, is dorans blade really worth ten times the asking price or is Ezreal just a dumbass?', \"You load into a game, you have some random ass bruiser as an ADC, your jungler picked Lulu, and your top laner is a Soraka.

So have a group stage with 2 groups in a double round robin. 1st group would be pool 1 and pool 2 teams this would look like T1, RNG, G2,PSG, EG, SGB with 6 teams . Second group would be pools 3 and 4 which would be DFM, AZE, RED, IW, ORD. half of each group would play every day and games would switch between both groups so there would be implications for every region every other game. After this would be a pre rumble knockout stage bottom 3 of group one vs top 3 of group in a best of 3, 4 vs 3, 5 vs 2, and 6 vs 1. Then would be another  double round robin with teams that placed 1-3 in group one and the 3 winners of the Bof3's. This round robin will have all 6 seeds move on but seeds 1 and 2 get bye in the following best of 5's. 3 vs 6 and 4v5 while 1st seed gets choice of opponent in the following round and 2nd seed gets the other. This gives all the pools more meaningful games, it makes every seeding matter and luck of draw is irrelevant. More games of the best vs the best. adding maybe one more day for the first knockout (at most 9 games and can be played at smaller venue) and another day for the extra 2 seeds from rumble stage getting through. \\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lmwwspfynaz81.png?width=902&format=png&auto=webp&s=76d9b28942386bbb8191fbcebfb61bb75f54ddd2\", \"\\\\*I said rumble and meant group stage.

We’ve seen changes to healing across the board, reduces to healing reduction, and an increase to tankiness. Yet there are zero changes to true damage, or %max hp damage. I’ve always thought that true damage was bad for the game, but if true damage remains as it is now, it will be detrimental to the game. These changes benefit every aspect of champions like Vayne. Not only do the tankiness changes significantly benefit those who have true damage, champions like Vayne and Fiora will actually be doing more damage than they currently are, in addition to being tankier. \\n\\nThe only real counterplay to Vayne is to CC or one shot her, even then it is extremely hard when she has Shieldbow, Guardian Angel, Randuin’s, etc. Without that, she is going to be pretty much unstoppable. \\n\\nDiscussing items, with the overall nerfs to all the anti-tank items, they are indirectly making all ADCs that aren’t inherently anti-tank worse, so this is a Kog’Maw and Vayne buff. By the way, I’d just like to note that Vayne has been a borderline broken top-tier ADC all season, so I think a nerf is overdue anyway.\\n\\nThe other champions that I think need to be looked at are: Gwen, Lilia, Camille, and Fiora.\\n\\nEdit: Forgot Master Yi, please nerf this champ in some way I’ve played against funnel too many times.', 'Hey  \\nI had a break from league for couple of years.

But the development team should understand it and start balancing around it. However every single patch it feels completely misunderstood or ignored. The first time I learned about EHP was in eve online when I started playing back in 2006 ish. They have this cool tool called EFT that keeps track of resistance, vamp \"lifesteal\", repair \"healing\", hull \"health, armor, and shield \"magic resist\". It shows you how much ehp you have and helps you decide what to sacrifice to increase damage without being an origami space ship. League doesn\\'t really have this because lifesteal and vamp are too hard to put consistent numbers toward.\\n\\nThe point however is that I don\\'t think riot even understands how this process works. Steraks for example adds far more ehp than any tank mythic as a legendary. Shields are a technical health buff without the downside of increasing max hp. And the regen makes it an insane value in team fights. But no one complains about steraks until a champ with a built in damage reduction or shield reset becomes damn near unkillable with it. Poppy, Warwick, irelia, jax, etc.\\n\\nWith the latest patch, I don\\'t think riot understands what giving everyone essentially a tank mythic will do to the game. Not every champ is the same and an artillery mage isn\\'t going to see the same performance out of a sunfire without a passive or affix as a Warwick or irelia.

Next thing, he thinks it funny to make me annoyed by locking in kalista, yone, zoe (champs isn\\'t exactly the problem here but you will see). He runs at mid, never comes to bot, and claims once I get 1 kill or 2 assists, I\\'m \"2v1\" so he never comes bot again. At times I literally beg him to come back but he just says \"haha seethe\" and he is diamond-master so he thinks everyone is worthless shit compared to him since I\\'m gold and we play in gold lobbies. He also lasts hits every kill as support and heavily always implies gold is useless on everyone but him because he\\'s diamond and the lobbies are gold.   \\n\\n\\n3       Whenever I play jg he always likes to trash-talk me for my performance sometimes. I literally, wouldn\\'t care if it was some random guy, but I\\'m literally in vc with him and I least expect to see the person I invited call me low elo trash + jg dif and spam pinging me. Also, when he plays jg and I sit under tower for a while, he purposefully ignores me when I ping him to gank and says \"haha seethe you feed\" when I literally have 0 deaths.   \\n\\n\\nI have told him so many times to stop, but he just says \"haha seethe\" and it is so annoying. What do I possible do.', 'I know what you\\'re thinking - I\\'ve overdosed on a massive amount of copium right? Wrong. The durability patch is massively going to shake things up, and it\\'s finally going to give NA a fighting chance at the trophy.\\n\\nTo understand why, we first have to understand why China and Korea have been dominant for so long. Now, a universally understood truth is \"you play the way you practice.\" So where do pro players practice the most? Solo queue. So let\\'s take a look at Korean solo queue.\\n\\nI\\'ve spent dozens of hours researching Korean solo queue by watching NA\\'s greatest 5 role challenger player, Tyler \"BIG TONKA T\" 1 destroy the Korean ladder. Once you\\'ve done as much research as me, you cannot escape the realization that Korean players are actually pretty terrible at league at everything but mechanics, which they get good at from low ping. They play fast paced fiesta games and snowball off kills. Once the durability patch hits however, champs will stop being one shotted, and mechanics will become far less important. This will allow NA to finally overcome Korea with their superior gameplay and macro knowledge - knowledge that players like the BIG TONKA himself have gained from the grueling NA ladder.\\n\\nNow I hear your objections. First, what about China? Well it\\'s known that the Chinese servers are even more fiesta heavy than the Korean servers, so they don\\'t stand a chance. But what about EU? Well to be sure, they will benefit just as much as NA from the patch. However, that just means that the winner of worlds will either be EU or NA. Two options means each has a 50% chance. Which means NA has a 50% chance. And 50% of the time, NA will win every time.\\n\\nTLDR: TSM\\'s bringing it home.', 'I noticed in my ranked games I can see the enemy’s border for the first time.

If you can't get a kill while landing everything these champs and lanes become worthless.  What else do any of these lanes have going for them?  Removing kill lanes is bad for the game because without the all in kill threat these champs become worthless.\\n\\nRiot needed to address certain outliers, like Rengars insane burst damage where he kills people in less than half a second.  Nerfing Rengars clear speed sure a nerf is a nerf, but his clear isn't why Rengar is an issue right now.  But instead of going after the problem champs riot decided to fk over the whole game and make some champs worthless instead.  I also think Vayne will be bonkers OP in patch 12.10 not nerfing Vaynes true damage while increasing tankiness.  Vayne has been really good all season and could use a preemptive nerf before she goes crazy in 12.10.\\n\\nThen you have enchanters that are already very very strong right now, the only real counter to a champ like Lulu is to pick Blitz and just instakill the squishy Lulu. Then we have Senna who will benefit more than most from the armor increase because hers is so low to begin with.  Let's also consider Senna is already really strong if not OP right now she didn't need any help.\\n\\nMelee supports in general need to have high kill threat otherwise ranged enchanters will just poke them out of lane for free.\\n\\n12.10 is likely to be a mess because riot took the lazy route of increasing the durability of everything instead of looking at and adjusting champs causing the problems.

This season, I created a new fresh acc to find out my true mmr and rank, and I learned a new role (was main adc, and started to play jg), I found a nice champion pool, I learned a lot about the game and about how to jungle in soloq, and in my new acc I started in silver 2 after placements with gold 3 mmr or something like that. I love the jungle role because I felt I improved a lot as a player, I have a lot of impact in the game and I achieve better climbing than playing ADC, but the other side of the coin is that spamming games a jungler is much harder than adc, the role is more demanding and is more tilting since you got all your team saying you how to play, when to gank, when to go herald or Drake, when they aren’t even able to set up a gank.\\n\\nWell, after this brief introduction, this are the main reasons why I continue playing ADC in my main acc to climb in soloq, and to spam games, since in my main acc my mmr was pretty bad because I demoted to iron 2 when I started playing soloq last season, therefore, I was not really worried about climbing immediately, but after a couple of weeks tryharding, I’m done with it. Firstly, this might be related with the role I’m playing now -ADC- but the games feel coinflip as hell. Imo, I’m better at ADC than at JG because mechanically I’m pretty solid at ADC, but somehow, I achieved better results in terms of climb, win rate and score playing jungle. But at the same time, I feel that this is not only related with the role itself, the real issue involved is the whole soloq mmr system, and it’s pretty simple to summarize it: I feel that my games are not about the best player wins, but the team that got the worst player of the lobby loses. On my last 20 games, in 17 of them I have won or lost depending on a troll that played for my or either the enemy team. I won games with 6.5 cs, an average score and an average dmg, and then I lost games with more than 8 cs, 10 KDA scores and being top dmg of the game, and is not entirely because \"ADC can’t 1v9\", the truth is that any role can’t nowadays, because soloq in low elo feels coinflip as hell.\\n\\nA few examples, in one game I was hard losing my lane and playing poorly but the enemy top laner decided to rage quit when he was 0-6, so we won, and today, I lost two games in which I was hard carrying, one of them because my jungle was soft inting because he was tilted with my mid laner, and the other one because my top laner ended 1-15-2 and basically afk farm in top side, stealing jungle camps to our jungler and recalling, doing this perma the whole game until we surrender. This happens every single time, there is at least one troll that will decide who wins and who loses the game, and if you are not smurfing or you have a huge skill difference over the other players (which is the same than being Smurfing at the end), you have no impact, you will win or lose depending on the matchmaking coinflip system.\\n\\nI want to know your opinion about this, and your experience playing soloq in low elo (silver) because it really feels you have no impact in your games, and they are basically random luck games.', \"Some time has passed [12.3] and I still don't understand why this change went through. \\n\\nRiot states:\\n\\n>Our approach to fighter Legendaries is similar: Shift health into AD across select items. Another top priority is to move Sterak's Gage out of being a go-to default option for all fighters. Lighter fighters should now be more intrigued by this reworked Death's Dance, which will scale with your other AD purchases and sustain tools. It also requires fighters to be constantly active in a fight to be effective, which is something we believe is important for systemic lighter fighter survivability.\\n\\nOkay, so the change was intended to add more variety for different types of fighters and shift everyone away from the standard 3rd item Sterak's rush. They also wanted to incentivize 'more activity' among fighters (even though old Sterak's already did this). \\n\\nWhat ended up happening?\\n\\nDeath's Dance is now practically mandatory for 95% of melee AD users. Literally every single champion that built old Sterak's just replaced it with Death's Dance. Every single AD jungler rushes this 2nd, and every single AD top laner rushes this 3rd. Except now you also have champions like Talon and Kha'zix (who this item is completely unintended for) also rushing it 3rd and snowballing even harder because this item does not accomplish what it's intended for. Show up, take a bunch of burst, 1-shot and run away. You just mitigated 30% of all the damage you took while healing on top of that! How does this playstyle encourage any sort of prolonged fighting as opposed to the Old Sterak's (where you still had to fight to get Bloodlust stacks)? \\n\\nNot to mention, the effect is genuinely shit and unclear to play against. Old Sterak's had a shield (visible how much more damage they can take, countered by Serpent's Fang) that also had a CD (pop it, back off, re-engage). Death's Dance's passive has legitimately 0 counterplay other than dealing true damage (which few champions have access to) and... not dying? It becomes even more toxic against snowballing leads in the mid-game, where you might simply lack the raw damage needed to burst whoever has it down before they can get a takedown and heal back up. \\n\\nI don't see how this change has benefitted fighters at all, and would love to hear some input because even as someone playing champions that frequently build it and the old Sterak's, I don't understand what this change has accomplished.\", 'I don\\'t hate challenges by any means, I actually quite like the implementation so far.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMy biggest complaint though is how do I find out what I actually did to earn a challenge?\\n\\nTake this example below. From what I understand, I am currently gold in the challenge and I would need to get 8 kill streak before 15 minutes to become Platinum. (I\\'d also unlock the \"title\" of Prodigy).\\n\\nThat\\'s great, but what did I do to get Gold?\\n\\nAnd I\\'m not looking for someone to post the answer to that question, I\\'m just wishing it was available in the client. Click on your challenge to see other \\'cards\\'. If anyone has played Legends of Runeterra, if a card can spawn another one then you\\'re able to click into it and view the card it spawns.

Low elo noobs, high elo players, GP onetricks, proplayers, streamers. Literally nobody believed that. He's pick ban in pro and his global ult is insanely strong and can turn fights, he's annoying to lane against and can spam oranges for heal. Riot should have just said they were buffing him because they wanted le epic barrel highlights for msi.\\n\\nTLDR: we got BARRELED\", \"I've got all skins but can't reroll for the following skins: High Noon Talon, EDG Aphelios, EDG Graves, EDG Viego, EDG Yuumi and EDG Zoe.  \\n\\n\\nIs it supposed to be like this? Hasn't been this way in the past.  \\nSeems like a weird move if intentional.\", 'First of all, I’d like to start this by recognizing riot did the right thing by replaying the games that they find to be affected against RNG. \\n\\nHowever, I find the argument that the ping affected the other games evenly because they both dealt with the ping issues. The random ping spikes could have negatively affected one team more than another in impactful moments. With the knowledge that the ping was a large issue, did riot go far enough?  It’s unlikely that they would ever replay the whole tournament, but this wasn’t an unforeseen issue. This entire Reddit was up in arms when it was announced, even despite the double standard. \\nIf Esports is to be taken seriously riot needs to step Their came up and be consistent and more fair with their rules.', 'I have been playing since S2 so I have seen Riot hate mages for the better part of a decade. I feel like the durability update should allow for some buffs to make the role still feel good and not devolve into an ADC dictated meta. In the dev blog Riot said they still want burst mages to be able to 100 to 0 if significantly far ahead, so there is precedent for keeping some damage tuning in the game despite a durability buff to all champions. I think about champions like Annie, who has never been allowed to be a staple pick for any significant amount of time when Riot wants to keep other midlaners like Ahri, Ori, TF, Sylas, Ryze (pro) in high pick/ban. I think the base durability changes allow for something like +.05AP to her Q W and R to keep Annie from being unplayable and maybe find a chance to be pickable. Since there is more durability in the botlane ap scaling buffs should make her not take over as a support and catch up to other mages that have been outperforming her for years. I think Annie is the best example to show what champions are probably safe to buff with the update, I understand why Riot has been against flat ratio and damage buffs and try to do fancy utility tuning but if every champion is getting flat durability there should be consideration for giving like 25% of that back as damage for some mages.', 'Hi guys I would really like to improve before I start Ranked I mainly play Illaoi and Zyra Support.

Don’t shoot the messenger!\\n\\n“Since the start of MSI, everyone in the team has been actively cooperating with all of the MSI standard technical tests and requirements. The team leader gets up at 8am. every day to cooperate with the test. This time, we can only \"cooperate.\" Our fans can only \"cooperate\" by watching three more games. Of course, we will cooperate with the follow-up, and any other requirements they ask of us. The reason why we cooperate fully is because the result is worthy of the hard work and efforts of the players and staff. They are all worth it, nothing else.\\n\\nThere is no special advantage gained when the players have to wake up for a few hours to take the PCR test every day and have no time to do ranks before the game. The only \"advantage\" may be that the players have to get up at 9am every morning for the test, and going to bed and waking up early is good for their health.”', 'After waiting twice for the ladder update expecting to have some challenges promoted to grandmaster/challenger I\\'m confused as to why some were promoted and others weren\\'t.   \\n\\n\\n\"Been here a while\" promoted on first day from master to grandmaster but today it didn\\'t change to challenger despite being above the shown value (level 500).  \\n\\n\\n\"Old Friends\" didn\\'t promote to grandmaster yesterday or today, and my score is way above the grandmaster value (150).  \\n\\n\\n\"Wise Master\" didn\\'t promote either while having over 1M extra over the grandmaster value (5M), and I even saw someone on ARAM with grandmaster tier despite having lower mastery points than me.  \\n\\n\\nFinally not really update ladder issue, but the \"Mile Marker\" challenge shows there is a next tier with the text \"next level rewards\" but there is no progress bar or ladder update message, is that normal?', 'Hi all, me and a friend are traveling through Korea the next couple of weeks.

I'm going to give a brief overview on my thoughts of on who, and when to build these items.\\n\\nDivine tsundere first, item purpose? Tank busting. So let's look at 3 of the most well known divine abusers, camille, viego and wukong. What do all these champs have in common? You guessed it, tanksmashing. Why? let's have a look. Camille has; max health damage on her W, current health damage on her R, and her Q does a boatload of true damage. Viego has a permanent mini bork passive, and his R does a lot of missing health damage, so tanks that stack hp will take a lot more damage from his R. Wukong has armour shred on his Q, and his R does a ridiculous 32% Max health total damage. All of these champs are built to shred tanks, so it makes sense to buy the tank busting item right? True, but there's a bit more.\\n\\nDivine sunderer gives a more well rounded sheen proc than trinity, in a lot of cases trinity does more damage, but divine can heal you for A LOT, meaning you can stay alive and output damage for longer. Where in theory trinity out classes divine is in sustained damage, now let's talk about why these 3 bruisers (bruiser viego only not talking about crit) still choose to build divine. Simply, they don't benefit from the stacking AD, and even more so, the attack speed from trinity, for one reason, they all have attack speed steroids in their base kit, at rank 5, all of their Es grant them 60% attack speed, yes 60%, veigos lasts as long as he's in his mist + he has a double strike after every ability effectively granting him double attack speed , and wukong and camille get it for 5 seconds, considering how much ability haste they get, they can keep this attack speed up very very frequently.\\n\\n Lastly, these champions, while strong extended duelists, are much burstier than other bruisers. If you've ever played against a fed viego, even if he's going tanky bruiser, if he lands W on you he straight up oneshots you from full hp. If you've ever been unlucky enough to be level 5 when wukong hits 6 in Lane, and your not under your tower and have Flash you'll know that wukong with his R just one combos you 100-0. And camille haha chogath R.\\n\\nNow onto trinity, will be a lot shorter since barely any champions actually build this item anymore, notable ones off the top of my head are darius and ezreal (not a bruiser but abuses all the bruiser items better than them anyway). Darius is, and is well known to be a tankbuster, he has armour pen for free from his E after all, but the reason Darius doesn't buy divine is because he desperately needs attack speed, and he can't buy any other items that grant it. He also has healing from his Q, so has less of a need for the sustain that divine gives. Darius needs to get 5 stacks as soon as possible, and since his identity is that he excels in long, drawn out fights where he can overpower his opponents with his superior ramping, backloaded damage, trinity is perfect from him since he utilises both the attack speed and the stacking ad to help him hit 5 stacks sooner and increase his R execute threshold.\\n\\nEzreal, being an Adc values attack speed a lot, yes his passive gives him attack speed, but for an Adc it's not that much, combined with the fact that he doesn't built any attack speed outside of his mythic, its why at least in high elo, Ezreal mains have dropped the essence reaver rush with crown/ duskblade and are again rushing trinity force as their go to.\\n\\nThis is just my take on what makes these items better than one another in specific scenarios and on different champions. So please, don't built divine sunderer on Jax or Yorick every game because you saw TF blade do it. Look at if you really need that survivability, or if you need to go Trinity to really brute force those 1v1s and actually oneshot squishies.\\n\\nThanks all for reading\", \"I've been checking intermittently throughout yesterday and today -  I thought ARURF was supposed to launch with the game last night, but I do not see it in the list of game modes.\", \"I've always had problems with this kind of thing, mainly on ARAM, but it usually disappeared by 1 min, now I can play a game in a row and here I am still having the problem with character lagging when I move, anyone knows of such a problem and has an idea how to solve it?On video Im holding PPM.\\n\\nhttps://reddit.com/link/uo70bm/video/eonldc2r33z81/player\", 'Can we talk about what is going on with the UI of the client?

I\\'ve not been having a lot of fun playing league lately, and I analyzed my games until I noticed the pattern. Whenever I play ADC, I feel awful. Win or lose, the emotions felt throughout the course of the game are just negative.\\n\\nTo provide some context, I usually play support, and I love it. I can freely roam the map, helping whoever needs help, laying down vision so my team has a nice bright map to make plays on. Sometimes I play top lane. I can get nice and beefy, so I can safely push out any given lane. If the enemy sends two people to attack me I can usually go 1 for 1, or if they send 3, that\\'s fine, I stall for time and my team takes something elsewhere.\\n\\nBut when I play ADC, it feels so... limited? I don\\'t really know how to describe it. After the 20 minute mark I don\\'t feel like I\\'m playing league of legends anymore, I\\'m playing the game of \"Where am I allowed to stand on the map?\" And the answer is usually \"Inside my base or at the nearest tower\".\\n\\nI can be safely fed, but I can\\'t actually fight anyone. Even a sufficiently even support can pop me if they land a CC from out of vision. I feel like I\\'m reduced to following whatever play my team wants to do, and hoping against hope that no assassins jump over a wall and delete me. Because even if I position in a spot I think is safe, there\\'s not much I can do about a talon or zed or leblanc who flash > ult > ignites me. I just have to hope that one or even better two people on my team are watching me to get some sort of interrupt CC off, which rarely happens in solo Q.\\n\\nSo, how do you have fun? How do you enjoy this role? What do you do, in game, to achieve an experience where after 20 to 30 minutes, win or lose, you can take a moment afterwards to say, \"That was fun, I enjoyed that.\"?

Nunu with these items just feels so weak. Its like youre a squishy, not a tank. Youre meant to be the frontline for your team, but you die just as soon as the AD carry if you go frontline. No matter how well i perform in early game (where nunu is most probably the strongest) it doesnt matter, because i fall off a cliff later on and i can only help secure objectives with my Q SMITE for my team.\\n\\nGame starts.

To verify the strange, Garena sent an email to DNS & requested some proof to explain the strange.\\n\\n\\\\- DNS needs to explain why 4 of 5 accounts didn’t sign up by the correct DNS member, while they also need to show the playing history (Tristana & TF) in which they played super well without any training before (in tournament accounts). DNS have 48 hours to defend by sending proof back to Garena.\\n\\n→ From my understanding, Garena is already quite sure about the fault of DNS before requesting this data. So the information that DNS are disqualified for “Playing Tristana and TF” is, in fact, just a part of the investigation and is provided as a piece of evidence, and shouldn’t be viewed as a sole reason for their disqualification. The email that the officials sent them was cut short to make it seem like Garena is unreasonable and shady to disqualify them. They even wrongly quoted the officials’ email, which is “In 3 months, you haven\\'t used Tristana and Twisted Fate, that seems suspicious to us, so we are going to disqualify you guys\". There is just no way Garena or any other organizations could use that kind of statement.\\n\\n*P/s: Garena post -* [*https://www.facebook.com/vcslmht/posts/8080068378671734*](https://www.facebook.com/vcslmht/posts/8080068378671734)\\n\\nSo we do have many reasons to believe that DNS are actually guilty, and they have actually bribed the referee and faked their whole line-up in the tournament. And when the things they did got exposed, they shed phony tears…I know some of you guys are anti Garena, and I do. But honestly, I believe that they did the right thing in this case.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8w79y8jgl2z81.png?width=386&format=png&auto=webp&s=8af1aa89e527c42060ad0d4658a0daee0d65f3bb', 'So before I get into challenges here\\'s a quick story on statistics first.\\n\\nI remember one time I was playing and only got 7.2 cs a min in a game that turned into a huge fiesta and my friend who was a higher rank watching the whole thing telling me my cs/min is why I wasn\\'t in a higher tier.\\n\\nI sat there thinking did you even watch the game? Do I go for 10 cs/min and let my jung invading without vision/knowledge spoon feed a blue kayn going lethality against a team with no tank?\\n\\nStatistics are a metric but they are not comprehensive, a single roam could win a game but you lose xp/cs in the process, farming while a skirmish that kills a team mate to get an item just before a major objective might be the difference in the last team fight.\\n\\nThe reality is one size can\\'t fit all but the game is promoting this concept of stats > all. cs/min, vs/min and so on.  While having these be high is never a bad thing if you chasing these stats ends up costing a baron, soul or being late to a 40min tf because everyone and their mother is telling you, you need to get them higher to climb or get better at the game then that affects gameplay. This use of stats is however unavoidable.\\n\\nNow with challenges the concept is you\\'re \"bronze\" if you haven\\'t achieved this that and whatever. So which is it? Are we platinum in solo que ladder but have silver challenges? So therefor we actually boosted? Are we gold in the ladder but have diamond challenges therefor my teammates are always at fault?\\n\\nPeople are going to lose games chasing challenges and that single handedly affects gameplay to achieve some rank that has nothing to with the current game being played and what needs to be done to win it. While eternals are for the most part just a tracking mechanism and shouldn\\'t really affect gameplay that much. I have however seen on occasion some people do some stupid things to get some ### of a stat with eternals.\\n\\nAn example is there is one challenge where you get points for not chatting in a solo que game? Really? What if you see something that you need to say, like said champ just got their core item be careful, but muh challenge? It will happen, and this is just one example.\\n\\nChallenges are fine as a stat tracking mechanism but with its current ranked system it will almost certainly become another metric to judge people by and therefor should be changed so it doesn\\'t affect gameplay.\\n\\nA riot mmo is coming, moba\\'s are suppose to be competitive experiences, leave the challenges/achievements and the \"prestige\" for having it for the mmo.', 'Hey, this is my first time posting something on Reddit I have a general question about event exclusive chromas and generally exclusive league content.\\n\\nDo you know (with evidence) if these cosmetics will return once the event reoccurs or not?', \"What is this new feature?\\n\\nI've just had a game where I played badly and got this notification. \\n\\nWhat is it detecting about my gameplay to give this notice?\", 'With the new Challenges live I played around a bit to find a nice looking combo of the stuff I already got.

(I brought you [jung.gg](https://jung.gg/) and that personality/champion recommender on [itero.gg](https://itero.gg/) )\\n\\nEach week I write an article for the publication [The Esports Analyst Club](https://medium.com/the-esports-analyst-club-by-itero-gaming), this week is on my favourite custom metric: **Snowballatility**™, or in other words: how does Gold impact the Champions win rate.\\n\\nWould love to hear your thoughts below!\\n\\nLet me ask you a question…\\n\\nImagine you’ve just loaded into the last game of your Platinum promotional series and your team decides to group together, just in case the enemy invades.\\n\\nYou’ve read them like a book. They head into your jungle to meet their demise. You clean ace them, with your Top laner securing a Penta Kill. He returns to base with 1600 Gold to spend.\\n\\nThe question is, if you could choose which Champion your Top laner was playing — who would it be? Ignore their current win rates. Take a second and actually think about it.\\n\\nBut why that Champion over any other? Does it really make a difference, isn’t 1600 Gold going to be just as effective on anyone?\\n\\n## The Gold Multiplier\\n\\nToday, we’re talking about a metric that I call “The Gold Multiplier”, but from my example above you may prefer the term *“Snowballatility”* (or not, depending on how much you like to abuse the English language).\\n\\nThe simple explanation is: how does Gold impact a Champions win rate?\\n\\nMathematically, we calculate it like so:\\n\\n* Find the 66th percentile of Gold @ 10 minutes. In other words, which value would mean that 66% of games are below it and 33% are above it.\\n* Flag all the games where a Champion is in this top 33% of Gold @ 10 (i.e. all the games where the Champion is notably ahead).\\n* Compare the Win Rate of these games vs. the Champions average game.\\n\\nSo, if a Champion had a 50% win rate but won 65% of their games when they were ahead at 10 minutes, their Gold Multiplier (*snowballatility*) is 1.30x (0.65/0.50).\\n\\nHere’s a look at some values\\\\* from Top laners:\\n\\n[Top Lane Champions Gold Multiplier When Ahead](https://preview.redd.it/4sa0tn1pg2z81.png?width=404&format=png&auto=webp&s=ced74ad39e3d4981819c7c132f851b9d6e883d12)\\n\\n* *All data is from patch 12.6, Diamond 2+ games from EUW, NA & KR. Minimum 1,500 games per Champion shown.*\\n\\nWhat surprised me when I first did this exercise was Renekton being the lowest. I thought he was a snowballing Champion? Get him ahead and win the game, right?\\n\\nWe have to differentiate the **probability** of a Champion getting ahead from its **effect**. Let’s take an ADC example for this one. Imagine Draven and Twitch. Who is the most likely to snowball? Draven. Who would be more likely to carry a game with a level 1 penta? Twitch.\\n\\nIt’s the same for Renekton, he has all the tools to get ahead but that doesn’t mean he’s the best when he’s there.\\n\\n## To be “Economic”\\n\\nIf you watch any amount of professional play, you’ve probably heard the term “eco(n)” before. It’s short for “economic” and it refers to how well a Champion or player performs with low resources. Or in other words, it’s the antithesis of snowballing. *Antisnowballatility*, if you like.\\n\\nWe can calculate it in a similar way, except rather than looking at all the games where a player is in the top 33% of Gold @ 10, we look at the bottom 33%.\\n\\nIn English: How does being behind in Gold impact win rate? Imagine the example from the beginning of this article, except this time it’s the enemy Top laner who gets the penta kill. Who do you want facing them?\\n\\n[Top Lane Champions Gold Multiplier when Behind](https://preview.redd.it/1fekojwrg2z81.png?width=405&format=png&auto=webp&s=56c1e7c292e1da19a40f0af6fcece31188c8749e)\\n\\nMalphite is a mountain, an immovable object. He’s going to be tough to kill. Even if you do, his ultimate ability still provides huge value in team fights. The same goes for Shen.\\n\\nIrelia and Riven? They're duelists. They go in, zip around, deal huge amounts of damage, flash their level 7 mastery and type “gg ez” in all chat. They offer nothing else. This playstyle doesn’t work so well if they’re considerably behind.\\n\\n## Snowballing my way to Full Build\\n\\nWhilst looking at this, a question occurred to me. Isn’t a Champions Gold Multiplier when ahead the same as their scaling? Think about it… it’s basically a metric to say how strong a Champion is with more Items, since that’s where the Gold goes. So, don’t Champions that scale well also snowball well?\\n\\nTo test this we first calculate a metric for “late game scaling” by taking all games in the top 33% of length and then comparing those win rates to the average. Again, in English: how many more games does the Champion win when the game goes late.\\n\\nNow, we can compare our original Gold Multiplier statistic for when Champions are ahead, to the new scaling metric for when the game goes late.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[The Correlation between a Champions Gold Multiplier and their Scaling](https://preview.redd.it/ilnpvm7ug2z81.png?width=392&format=png&auto=webp&s=daaab26ed510f1eaf5470933b6f51dd09b5590a0)\\n\\nIn general, there is a slight preference for “snowballers” to also be “scalers”, but it’s far from a perfect correlation.\\n\\nLook at **Volibear** — he’s a monster when he’s ahead (1.46x) but really struggles during the late game (0.95x).\\n\\n**Irelia** is below average with a gold lead (1.37x) but is above average past the 35 minute mark (1.02x).\\n\\n**Ornn** is an outlier as his late-game prowess is related to his passive upgrades. Even if he got a penta kill at level 1, he still can’t unlock any new items for the team until later into the game.\\n\\n**The Esports Impact**\\n\\nSince I’m writing for [The Esports Analyst Club](https://medium.com/the-esports-analyst-club-by-itero-gaming), I should probably explain how this relates to professional play.\\n\\nAs an esports team you’ll spend hours discussing how best to draft against an upcoming opponent. There’s the obvious factors, like the strongest Champion in the meta, counter picks and synergies or a players personal comforts.\\n\\nHowever, choosing a Champion with the “right” level of Gold Multiplier should also be a consideration. It’s all about identifying the play style and skill gaps across the map and exploiting these.\\n\\nDo you have a famously strong top/jungle pairing who always get ahead? Are they facing the worst top laner in the league? Take Camille, Jayce or Yone, get ahead and snowball. Avoid Sion, Sett or Darius.\\n\\nI have a perfect example of this, although I wouldn’t *exactly* call it esports. I’m a Platinum ranked player and I was playing off-role in our bi-weekly Clash tournament. The average Elo was around high Gold, but I ended up face-to-face with a Diamond I Irelia.\\n\\nLuckily for me, I had this data handy and so locked in Malphite and accepted my fate. Yes, I went 30CS down but I never died.\\n\\nHere’s my biggest contribution to us winning that game:\\n\\nhttps://i.redd.it/2ej0f5ewg2z81.gif\\n\\nIf you got this far down the article, I thank you! Long form content is (by name), more time consuming and not something you see very often in the space. I'm trying to do my part by writing weekly articles in the AI/Data/Esports space.

Is it dropping later? Does anyone know?\", \"I've seen a lot of negative posts about challenges, which is honestly par for the course as far as the internet goes (change, ew).  Instead of responding to each post individually I thought it would make more sense to just post my thoughts one time.\\n\\nOverall I really like challenges (and partially related the post game lobby which I'll get to).  As a player I'm midway between casual and competitive (due to life, mostly casual the past two years).  I don't particularly enjoy the ranked grind, but tend to do it because I like unlocking the rewards.  Challenges scratch that itch of wanting something to work towards without all the stress that comes with ranked.  So far, at least on my end, they seem to pretty much be working as intended with a few minor bugs (but nothing outside the realm of expectance and nothing that has actively hindered my experience).\\n\\nSo pretty much I think these are a slam dunk for me.\\n\\nThe only constructive criticism I have is that I think in the challenges tab (under profile) would benefit from having a see all category, and having the overarching names of the categories mention what game mode it specializes in.  It's a little confusing when first looking at them to navigate, but not too difficult once you figure it out.  Would be a good QoL fix.  Would also like tracking to display total progression vs current progression to next rank (like mastery score).  Also, please add ability to track total numer of poros exploded in ARAM, plz and thank you (gotta go for that grandmaster poroality).\\n\\nTo address some other people's comcerns with the update:  \\n\\nPost game screen is fine.  I like seeing the challenges I made progress on, if you don't like them it takes two extra seconds to skip.  Also, the ordering makes sense.  More people will spend less time examining challenge progression than stats, so putting the easily skippable screen first makes more sense than having it pop up AFTER you look at the stats screen for details.  \\n\\nStats screen update is great.  I love the cleaner look and the relevant information is much easier to access.  Chat being hidden doesn't bother me.  I feel (no evidence to back this up) most people don't even look at post game chat, probably because most people use it to flame.  If you really wanted to talk to someone you'd probably be selecting the text box to type anyways, so the decision works for me.  I get the complaints about it and am not trying to say anyone's complaints about it being hidden are invalid, just saying that I actually don't mind (and actually prefer) it being mostly hidden.\\n\\nI know it's the cool thing to dunk on the Riot client, but in this specific case I think they did a mostly alright job and I'm really excited to start working on challenges because, and this was probably the intent, they're fun (and free).\", 'Maw of Malmortius change would be cool to see if item allowed to buy with Immortal Shieldbow , so the way i would change it is make this item be really good (niche option) in games where you on Adc/ad assassin need to survive magic burst somehow to do anything, so Maw of Malmortius lose its unique passive and get active ability that with 60 sec cd give you 250+25/lvl magic dmg shield for 4 sec, so u can use it at the start of fight if u need it to make item flexible (700 total, base shield not low like 100 hp to allow u buy it as second item vs heavy magic dmg teams)\\n\\nZhonya\\'s Hourglass about this i am not sure if its good idea, but Riot can try make it have more than 1 option by allow to cast it on enemy champs in 600\\\\~ cast range but \"Statis\" duration is 1 sec only (it can be dodged with spell shields (Banshies/Edge of Night/morgana E, enemy Zhonya\\'s), abilities that make champs Untargetable (Kled dismount/Kayne ult/fizz E and etc) what do u think?', 'Source: https://twitter.com/GoldenGuardians/status/1524572273058803712\\n\\nSeems a really weird choice considering that GGS has no signed ADCs if Lost is going to IMT, and considering that due to covid and visa issues he only joined halfway through the season.\\n\\nViolet doesn\\'t seem to have expected this either since his bio still reads \"ADC for @GoldenGuardians\" and pinned tweet is GGSA\\'s spring lineup.\\n\\nWonder where he\\'s moving to now, I really liked him.', 'Im kinda new.

champions\\n2 by far the worst P in the game, which further makes his kit one of a status checker, there are so many ways u can give him sustain in the lane faze but this is arguably the worst way\\nDisclaimer: everything says here are nonuses to what his kit already has, unless it's mentioned that one thing will be removed \\n\\nP: Soul Eater: removed\\nResurrection: every time a normal minion of his dies near him, Nasus can right-click on him to resurrect them in a Mummy, doing that will consume mana, those mummies will follow Nasus and heal him every 2 seconds, the mummies will not be in sink so that it's more of a passive heal rather than a burst of heal every 2 seconds, and the mummies will make sure to stay behind Nasus( idk how to explain but they will stay behind Nasus but as close to their team nexus as well, so that if Nasus makes a turn they dont just start advancing towards the enemy nexus) if Nasus has 20(20 or something like 50, it depends on how easy Nasus can gain and keep the mummies alive) when he dies they will give their life to resurrect him\\nPalace of Death and Rebirth: After lv 6 every minion that enters Nasus base will deal 30-50-70% (based on R lv) less damage, Nasus will also gain 20% of all gold of every minion killed, every stack he gains inside his team base will be doubled, in addition, his time to respond will be cut in half and will be ghosted for as long as he stays inside the base\\n\\nQ: Siphoning Strike: the stacks now will further empower the duration of his abilities, he can Q the mummies he summoned for stacks, 2 for every mummy, but doing that too often will make the mummies to fear him and stop following him\\nNow it will also deal bonus damage based on the target missing health\\n\\nW: Wither: a skill shot that comes from the back and goes towards Nasus, if it hits an enemy it will slow and silence them, if the enemy stays in Nasus E they will be stunned instead for 2 seconds\\nIf the skill shot reaches Nasus he will gain a portion of his missing health back and ms\\nThe distance it starts it's fixed\\n\\nE: Spirit fire: the damage will scale based on the target bonus health, if Nasus kills a unit with Q inside of it the stacks he gains will be doubled\\nThe radius of it is reduced by 30%, but the duration and size of it can be increased with stacks\\n\\nR: Fury of the Sands: The damage around Nasus will be based on the number of stacks he has and the Health, Armor, and Mr based on the number of mummies he has \\n\\nIdk if this completely made him a non-stats checker champion but this will surely

\"how to implement a painter\" or something\\n\\nand i got an idea\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\np: the painter can see the plants, though they dont create vision around them. for a while after they have been proced you\\'ll be able to see the remains of the plant\\n\\n\"the remains\" is used to proc your q, tho it wont take on a new w\\n\\nthis will be a good tool for jungle tracking but also plays  a part in her q ability\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nq: paint the plant that normally resides in a location as your skill, replace your w if the plant hasnt been procced\\n\\npainting a blast cone creates a knockback skill that can knock over walls, vision plant creates vision and the healing plant heals, yknow like the plants. this skill can be placed up to 300 units away from you\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nw: create an zone around you based on your q. base zone does base damage. blast does a burst of damage. scryer reveals weak spots, shredding a percentage of resistances of enemies while in the zone, berries makes it a regenerative mist instead,, providing a heal over time.\\n\\nwhile q can heal and w can heal, the heal power would not be up to most sustain champs\\' heal power, as theres 2 abilities, though inconsistent for healing\\n\\ne: the painter does  shortranged slamwith her paintbrush (thinking of lillie e but no dash and a straight line skillshot instead of a  circular target sorta thing) dealing more damage and stunning if you are closer to her\\n\\nr: this is the one i have the most trouble with, but maybe something like\\n\\npaint a  meadow on the ground, creating a zone which slows enemies and reduces their auto attack speed and speeds up allies\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nthis champ feels like a yordle to me, with her gimmicky feeling abilities, but i think itd be a fun melee support to play. the only problem is i feel like as a melee champ in my imagining the healing will be lackluster because of not building heal power if you try to be a tanky support, but if you play moonstone build she will just not be able to get the pressure of her zones, nor the blastcone qs thta i imagine she could do safel, but i  imagine her as melee, so i think i

Not to mention this doesn't solve other champions that are left underpowered in solo queue due to pro skewed power such as Orianna, Syndra, Aphelios, Lee Sin, Azir, Corki, Jayce, Gwen, and Renekton.\\n\\n*But Pro players wouldn't be able to practice these champions in solo queue.*\\n\\nGiven the purpose of pro play specific nerfs is to take these champions out of pro play this doesn't seem like a bad thing to me. \\n\\n*This change would widen the gap between upcoming pro players and actual pro players.*\\n\\nNot necessarily.
